 NewAnomalyEvents.100.Name:0 "A Star moving like a Cell"
 NewAnomalyEvents.100.Desc:0 "The rotational velocity relative to the galactic plane of this star is not consistant with the other A class stars encountered before. After a long observational period the crew tried to describe that unprecedented behavior and to the surprise of the scientific crew, all the movement of that star could only be compared to one of a lost cell idling in the space. Could it be a proof that our universe maybe be infinitely big? Who knows?"
 NewAnomalyEvents.110.Name:0 "Writable Star"
 NewAnomalyEvents.110.Desc:0 "The composition of this B class is unique, it appears that a simple beam laser is able to create a strange themal disruption within the star leaving a permanent mark.

 NewAnomalyEvents.130.Desc:0 "An abandoned energy havesting station composed of unknown material of unprecedented strength has been located near this G class star, it seems to be deactivated for an unknown amount of time. Our scientific staff wasn't able to active it again but we found a large stockpile of energy which was probably constructed in order to keep the station active even after the death of that star. Something which won't happen for billions of years so we decided to use that energy for our own purposes."
 NewAnomalyEvents.140.Name:0 "Engineers Inside"
 NewAnomalyEvents.140.Desc:0 "We have located a very weak signal coming from this K class star, and it appears that an engineering outpost has been detected directly inside the stars. But the most interesting part is the fact that some people of an unknown species are inside and doesn't seem to like having us around for a long time. As they know that we can't reach them, they decided to share some interesting engineering data in exchange for leaving them and never returning."
 NewAnomalyEvents.150.Name:0 "Drifting Box"

 NewAnomalyEvents.160.Name:0 "Avoided Disaster"   
 NewAnomalyEvents.160.Desc:0 "A weak signal was coming from a very small passage near that black hole. After a closer inspection we found something horrific and repulsive that is impossible to describe with other words. The crew are convinced, that monster was trying to reach our galaxy. But our scientific team kept their heads cool and managed to close the small gate linking us to the realm of that horror by lauching a projectile at a very high speed which quickly created a chain reaction with the energy of the black hole and sealed the passage forever."
 NewAnomalyEvents.170.Name:0 "Super Pulsar"
 NewAnomalyEvents.170.Desc:0 "This pulsar is much larger than most of the ones we previously encountered, the energy coming out of is exceptional.

 NewAnomalyEvents.180.Name:0 "Attracting Minerals"
 NewAnomalyEvents.180.Desc:0 "This solar system is very rich in mineral dust but as they were too small gathering them all would take centuries. Instead our science crew have an idea, they knew that these dust minerals could all be attracted with the help of the neutron star with this magnetic attraction.

 NewAnomalyEvents.192.Desc:0"Something very bad happened here, the only suspicious things present in that city where the clothes of his inhabitants, the material of these clothes doesn't seem to be affected by the time and could be useful for us. But because of it we are not able to estimate when the tragedy happened here, the only clue we found was a message in the pocket of one of the clothes of a citizen which after a serious translation said that they fighted together and with unity until the end. It is impossible to say today who was their enemy but something certain is the fact that we should seriously take example of their bravery."
 NewAnomalyEvents.192.a:0"We will honor them."
 NewAnomalyEvents.192.b:0"Take the clothes and leave."
 NewAnomalyEvents.193.Name:0"Rich City"
 NewAnomalyEvents.193.Desc:0"We can be sure that the inhabitants of that city were very 'well-to-do', but something forced them to abandon their planet very quickly and that before having the time to take all their fortune. We won't be able to take all the treasures that they left behind and many ships of what appear to be smugglers have been spotted which mean that they are going to loot everything remaining here. We must leave as soon as possible, and so what is the choice?"
 NewAnomalyEvents.193.a:0"Take the money."

 NewAnomalyEvents.200.Name:0"Advanced Creature"
 NewAnomalyEvents.200.Desc:0"The corpse of that colossus was fascinating our scientic crew wasn't even able to explain exactly how that very strange creature was able to use the properties of exotic physics at a level which was far beyond our knowledge. The only thing we could do is an estimation of the velocity acheved by the creature's skeleton which started to slowly appear thanks to decomposition. Such a discovery will help us a lot in the understanding of physics."
 NewAnomalyEvents.201.Name:0"Skin of Jewels"
 NewAnomalyEvents.201.Desc:0"We have found something very fascinating on the surface of that body, it appears that the skin is composed of jewels able to resist the body decomposition.

 NewAnomalyEvents.202.Name:0"Tyankis Inside"
 NewAnomalyEvents.202.Desc:0"We have detected some activity inside the dead space organism. After a long discussion the crew decided to open a hole large enough to check what is inside without allowing it break free. And what we found were some passive Tiyanki Space Whales. The most intersting part is the fact that they seemed to thank us for helping them to break free by doing a sort of dance, and they are actually following us which will help the study of their specie."
 NewAnomalyEvents.203.Name:0"Regenerating Corpse"
 NewAnomalyEvents.203.Desc:0"This is something you don't see everyday, even after it's death which can be dated to many centuries before the dead body of the creature is still regenerating from any damage taken. So a good question could be asked here, is that monster dead or not ? Fear started to take over the ship and the crew decided to leave as soon as possible but in the end they still managed to make a very insteresting study of the regenerating corpse and claim that we could do the same with our ships."
 NewAnomalyEvents.204.Name:0"Abandoned Ships"

We have found inside an ancient machine of a very crude design who challenged us to a game which seemed to be analogous to chess from our own civilization. After losing some rounds we finaly managed to defeat the machine and as a reward it gave us some blueprints to let us know how these primitive engineers managed to develop artificial intelligence so soon."
 NewAnomalyEvents.213.Name:0"A Power Plant"
 NewAnomalyEvents.213.Desc:0"The astrocartographic chart gave us the location of a giant deactivated powerplant. After turning it on the huge amount of energy generated from it was so amazing that the engineering crew confirmed that it could be exploited from space with a mining station."
 NewAnomalyEvents.220.Name:0"Trapped Alien"
 NewAnomalyEvents.220.Desc:0"A spaceborn alien was found trapped in the micro-wormhole, if nothing was done that creature was going to be killed. After a close inspection of the wormhole the crew estimated that the spaceborn alien wasn't hostile and so they decided to help it escape with the help of a grappling hook and thrusters of the science vessel. The rescue was very satisfying for the crew and the creature rewarded them with a very beautiful sound, the crew remained stunned in front of it and allowing the little creature to escape."
 NewAnomalyEvents.221.Name:0"A Strange Device"
 NewAnomalyEvents.221.Desc:0"A strange device was found in the other side of the micro-wormhole. It is impossible to explain the purpose of the object but something insteresting is the secondary purposes which functioned as a multi-tool kit with a large number of functions."

 NewAnomalyEvents.222.Desc:0"A very big sapphire has been found in the other side of the micro-wormhole, the size of the sapphire is close to that of one of our own species and the crew believe it can be collected. While they still have no idea of how that jewel ended up here but the value of it in the market is going to be very lucrative."
 NewAnomalyEvents.223.Name:0"Unknow Generator"
 NewAnomalyEvents.223.Desc:0"That mini wormhole was in the end not natural but artificial and the source of it was quickly spotted. The reserve of energy which appeared to be very low could explain why the wormhole was so small and still shrinking little by little. So in the end the crew decided to extract the rest of the energy present inside before it being depleted once for all."
 NewAnomalyEvents.230.Name:0"Hacking Successful: Reactor Core"
 NewAnomalyEvents.230.Desc:0"The crew finaly managed to hack the lone computer. It appears that even after thousands of years the session of the man who was on that computer beforehand remained open because that genius managed to create an energy reactor with a storage large enough to keep it online for an eternity. In the end thanks to the hack the crew managed to extract informations on the species who vanished from that planet as well as the functioning of the reactor to shut the computer once and for all."
 NewAnomalyEvents.231.Name:0"Hacking Successful: Android Armies"
 NewAnomalyEvents.231.Desc:0"The crew finaly managed to hack the lone computer.
